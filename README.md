This repository contains coursework from Fundamentals of IT, where I was introduced to various foundational concepts in technology. The course provided some exposure to HTML and CSS, allowing me to learn basic web development principles, as well as an introduction to Python, where I practiced fundamental programming concepts. This class helped build a broad understanding of IT and programming essentials, serving as a stepping stone for more advanced topics.
